Ineffective and inflexible traffic signal control at urban
intersections can often lead to bottlenecks in traffic flows and
cause congestion, delay, and environmental problems. How to
manage traffic smartly by intelligent signal control is a significant
challenge in urban traffic management. With recent advances in
machine learning, especially reinforcement learning (RL), traffic
signal control using advanced machine learning techniques
represents a promising solution to tackle this problem. In this
paper, we take images from the CCTV cameras at traffic junctions
as input for real-time traffic density calculation using image
processing and object detection. Better accuracy is achieved in the
detection of multiple vehicles with the YOLO algorithm. Shorter
vehicle waiting times are achieved by intelligent monitoring
technology's usage of a signal-switching algorithm at signal
intersections to coordinate time distribution and ease traffic
congestion. In the simulation experiment, we will use Pygame , a
cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video
games and different types of simulations.
